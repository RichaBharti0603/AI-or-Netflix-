I thought I knew you, but I was wrong.


Every secret has a price.


You don’t get to walk away now.


This city eats the weak.


I saw something I shouldn’t have.


There’s no turning back from this.


Trust me — I’ve got a plan.


You think this is over?


We’re already too deep.


Don’t make me choose.


They’re watching us.


You have no idea what I’ve been through.


Stay close and stay quiet.


We do this together or not at all.


You lied to me.


This isn’t what it looks like.


I need answers.


You’ll regret that.


I’m not afraid of you.


I’ve waited for this moment.


It’s not over until I say it is.


I trusted you.


You don’t get to walk away unscathed.


The truth will set you free — or destroy you.


We have to move now.


You messed with the wrong person.


I always find a way.


No one leaves until we’re done.


This was never random.


I knew something was off.


Now you tell me?


You’re hiding something.


Don’t look back.


There’s power in silence.


You carry too much guilt.


I’ve been waiting for your moment of weakness.


We’re not safe here.


Take your shot.


I’ll handle it from here.


You don’t understand.


This changes everything.


I don’t forgive easily.


One more step and you’re done.


I’m not the villain you think I am.


You’re running out of time.


I’m not alone anymore.


It wasn’t meant to be like this.


Keep your friends close — and your enemies closer.


I’ll see you on the other side.


Don’t let them win.


I have a bad feeling about this.


We have bigger problems.


You think I’m scared?


The world will never be the same.


You’re underestimating me.


We start at dawn.


I didn’t choose this life.


One mistake cost everything.


I’m done hiding.


If you walk away now, you’re dead to me.


I’m counting on you.


You still don’t get it, do you?


They betrayed us.


I won’t let fear control me.


This is war.


I saw the future — and it wasn’t pretty.


You left me no choice.


This was supposed to be easier.


Don’t ever touch me again.


I put everything on the line.


I won’t die without a fight.


You’ll be sorry.


I’ll protect you.


We are stronger than you think.


I’ll never forget what you did.


You’re more dangerous than you seem.


We don’t have forever.


I choose you.


This has gone too far.


Nothing stays buried forever.


You’re playing a dangerous game.


I won’t let you walk away with that.


I should have known better.


You haven’t seen anything yet.


Let’s finish this.


I trusted the wrong person.


Don’t underestimate their resolve.


You’re on your own now.


I can’t lose you.


There’s no excuse for betrayal.


I needed you then.


This is bigger than us.


I don’t do apologies.


I’m not giving up.


That’s not who you are.


We were so close.


I swore I’d protect you.


It’s too late for regrets.


I never wanted this.


You made your bed.


I’m finally free.


You have to trust me.


I’ve waited too long for this.


Don’t run from your past.


They promised safety — they lied.


I won’t be silenced.


You broke me.


I’ll make this right.


They think they can control us.


I heard everything.


That was a mistake.


You changed everything.


I’ll never forgive myself.


We’ll find a way.


I need you here.


We’re out of options.


You’re not getting away.


I didn’t ask for your help.


This belongs to me.


I can’t stay here.


They underestimated you.


I’m stronger than you think.


You’re not going alone.


I’m done with secrets.


We finish what we started.


I saw through your lies.


You’re exactly where I want you.


I won’t go down quietly.


It’s time to decide.


I’m not afraid to die.


You have no backup.


I’ll be right behind you.


Don’t make promises you can’t keep.


I’ll never leave you.


They’ll pay for this.


I can’t do this without you.


You’re not the same person anymore.


This is our only shot.


I won’t let this define me.


We’ll get through this.


You betrayed your own kind.


I expected better.


I’ll take the fall.


You’re running out of excuses.


I want the truth.


They’re coming for us.


I can fix this.


You crossed a line.


I’ll always choose you.


This has to end now.


I see your fear.


I’ll stand by you.


There’s no room for weakness.


We have to fight.


You’re my family.


I don’t trust easily.


I’ll face it alone.


You don’t scare me.


We lost everything.


I can’t protect you.


You owe me nothing.


I never expected this.


You changed your mind?


I want no part of this.


No one gets out alive.


I’m not bargaining.


We’re finished here.


I won’t be controlled.


You belong with me.


I can’t forgive you.


We’re in this together.


I’ll carry this burden.


There’s no easy way out.


I won’t stop fighting.


You made your choice.


I need to know why.


Don’t look me in the eye.


You’re not ready.


This isn’t a game.


I won’t let you suffer.


We don’t get second chances.


I can’t forget.


You’re all I have left.


I’ll always remember.


There’s no hiding now.


I’m done running.


You have to face the truth.


I’ll break every rule for you.


This isn’t just about revenge.


I’m not giving in.


You chose your fate.


I’ll be waiting.


We have to stay alive.


You betrayed our trust.


I can’t go back.


You have no idea what’s coming.


I’ll fight for us.


This is just the beginning.


I’m losing control.


You’ll never see it coming.


I won’t back down.


You left me no choice.


I believed in you.


This was never fair.


I’ll do whatever it takes.


You’re a monster.


I’m counting every second.


We’re unstoppable.


I’ll never doubt you again.


You’re walking into danger.


I’ll take my chances.


We have to trust each other.


I can’t let you go.


You’re not alone.


I’ll protect what matters.


This is our fight.


You’re braver than you think.


I won’t let fear win.


We don’t have long.


You’re closer than you think.


I’ll never break.


We owe them nothing.


I can hear your heartbeat.


You’re the only one I trust.


I won’t give up hope.


We’ll make it through.


I’ll do the impossible.


You’re my last hope.


I’m ready.


You can’t hide forever.


I’ll find you.


We’ll survive this.


I can’t stop thinking about you.


You changed my life.


I’ll be okay.


We have to stay strong.


You’re safe with me.


I’ll never forget you.


You’re worth the risk.


I can’t lose you again.


We’re alive — that’s what matters.


I’ll make them pay.


You’re everything to me.


I can’t control this anymore.


We’ll figure it out.


You’re the key.


I won’t be defeated.


We’re too late.


I’ll carry your memory.


You changed everything.


I won’t let you suffer.


We need a miracle.


You’re stronger than you know.


I won’t forget this moment.


We can still win.


I’ll fight beside you.


You’re not forgotten.


I’ll always protect you.


We have hope.


You’re my reason.


I’ll never give up on you.


We’ll find the truth.


I’m right here.


You’re not alone anymore.


I’ll take the lead.


We’ll make it count.


You’re the one I trust.


I’ll do it for you.


We’ll overcome this.


You’re the bravest person I know.


I’ll follow you anywhere.


We’ll make our own fate.


You’re the light in the darkness.


I’ll stand with you.


We’ll rise again.


You’re not giving up.
